	The <a href="https://www.softcover.io/">Softcover</a> publishing platform was designed mainly for ebooks like the <a href="https://railstutorial.org/book"><em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em> book
	</a> and <a href="https://learnenough.com/html"><em>Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous</em></a>, but it's also good for making more traditional books, such as the novel <em>Moby-Dick</em> by Herman Melville (sometimes written as <em>Moby Dick</em>).  We present below a short / irreverent book report on this American Literature classic.

	<a href="https://www.softcover.io/read/6070fb03/moby-dick" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Moby-Dick</em>
	</a> by Herman Melville begins with these immortal words:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
	<p>
	  <span>Call me Ishmael.</span> ome years ago–never mind how long
          precisely–having little or no money in my purse, and nothing
          particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a
          little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of
          driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.
	  </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
	After driving off his spleen (which <em>likely isn't</em> good for you), Ishmael then goes on in much the same vein for about a thousand pages.
